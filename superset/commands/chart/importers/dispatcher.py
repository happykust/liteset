"""Async port of ``superset_old/commands/chart/importers/dispatcher.py``.

Dispatches a chart import to the registered command versions (currently
only v1) until one matches the supplied contents, preserving the upstream
version-fallback semantics:

* :class:`IncorrectVersionError` from a version → skip to the next one;
* :class:`CommandInvalidError` / validation error from a matched version →
  reraise (real validation errors must not be masked by trying older
  formats);
* no version matched → final
  ``CommandInvalidError("Could not find a valid command to import file")``.
